## Introduction
### Portfolio with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Graduating from my Front End Web Development Bootcamp with SkillCrush required a portfolio website. This was my first portfolio I'd ever built, and the code includes two versions. 

Version 2 can be viewed at https://egoullaud.github.io/portfolio/

#### Version 1 
The first version was incredibly simple - a black background with headings, content, and pages for projects, about, and contact. I was unhappy with the design and lack of JavaScript, so it was a temporary "first draft" of my portfolio.

##### Technologies 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 5

#### Version 2
The second version improved upon the design quality and incorporated JavaScript. I added a logo, photoshopped some custom pictures, and selected a color scheme for the site. I added JavaScript to add interactivity with the site page with the buttons, navigation, and cursor.

## Challenges

My main challenge with this site was design and time management. I didn't want to pour weeks into this project, but also wanted the design to be unique and effectively communicate my personality. In the end the first version of the site took much longer than anticipated, as I waffled on the design aspects. The second version improved the design and utilized JavaScript. It took a lot longer to develop the second version as I spent a large amount of time in the design process, picking brand logo and colors, and also researching website layout techniques. 

## Next Steps

The next step will be an entirely new portfolio made with React. This portfolio was a wonderful start to practicing my skills and improving the site as I learned new concepts, however I have an entirely new idea for a portfolio!
